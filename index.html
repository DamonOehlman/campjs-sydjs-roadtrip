<p>Purpose of this repository is to coordinate a roadtrip down to <a href="http://v.campjs.com">CampJS V</a> from Sydney.  While planes are lovely and all, @jedwatson mentioned he was road tripping with the @thinkmill crew and I thought, &quot;hey that&#39;s a pretty good idea&quot;.  So I started trying to think about what it might look like if we got a few more people involved.</p>
<h2 id="rally-points">Rally Points</h2>
<p>With a few of us travelling down, with a number of vehicles it makes sense to organise a couple of logical points at which to meet. The <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/Sydney+NSW/Lord+Somers+Camp,+Cnr+of+Lord+Somers+Rd+and+Parklands+Avenue,+Somers+VIC+3927/@-36.099388,145.7157327,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m18!4m17!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b129838f39a743f:0x3017d681632a850!2m2!1d151.2069902!2d-33.8674869!1m5!1m1!1s0x6ad5e9db89064cd5:0xf04567605314b70!2m2!1d145.144826!2d-38.390751!2m3!6e1!7e2!8j1432317600!3e0">suggested route</a> from Sydney sees us heading pretty close to Campbelltown. So I would probably suggest this as a good final rally point.</p>
<p>While my knowledge of Sydney is limited, this seems to be a location that is fairly easy to get to both by car and <a href="http://www.sydneytrains.info/stations/station_details?stationId=62">by rail</a>. With a major shopping centre nearby (no idea of how good or bad it is) we should be able to park cars and coordinate pretty easily from there.  There&#39;s also grocery and stores nearby for any roadtrip snack purchases that might be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="intermediate-rally-points">Intermediate Rally Points</h3>
<p>Depending on how easy it is for folks to get to Campbelltown, it might be possible to have a few other secondary rally points that drivers can do a pickup from.  For instance, it would be easy for me to do a pickup from <a href="http://www.sydneytrains.info/stations/station_details?stationId=84">Sutherland Station</a> if that was an easy place for a few people to get to.  If there is a similar location for you, and you are keen to join on the roadtrip feel free to do a PR and add your location to the <a href="locations.geojson">locations.geojson</a> file.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-in-">I want in!</h2>
<p>If you want in on this, then the following criteria are required / desirable:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be willing to pitch in on the driving (given the vehicle owner&#39;s insurance permits this). If you don&#39;t have a license, then let us know when you get in touch. If most people are able to drive it will be a complete non-issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Help cover the cost of fuel. Unfortunately, we still require horrible fossil fuels to power these beasts to be willing to help cover petrol costs.  I&#39;ll do some calcs to provide an indicative figure of what is helpful given distance, etc closer to the time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be able to cope with the drive. It&#39;s a pretty long drive and while I&#39;m sure the first 5 hours will go super fast bagging out jQuery or alternative target, you&#39;ll require some stamina to enjoy the trip.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the right attitude this will be awesome, and most likely heaps more fun than flying. So if you are keen, <a href="https://github.com/DamonOehlman/campjs-v-sydjs-roadtrip/issues/1">register your interest</a>.</p>
